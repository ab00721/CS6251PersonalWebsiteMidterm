            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div id="indent">Hello! My name is Anna Blood and my skills are focused in math and science.
                I graduated from New College of Florida in 2019 with a Bachelors degree in
                chemistry, then from Emory University in 2021 with a Masters degree in organic
                chemistry. Now, I am in school to earn a second Masters degree in Computer Science
                from the University of West Georgia.</div>

            <h2>Tutoring</h2>
            <div id="indent">I have been working as a math and science tutor since high school. With 9 years of
                experience in pre-k through college level tutoring, I recently started a tutoring company
                called <span class="brightMinds">Bright Minds Tutoring</span>, which focuses on math
                and science tutoring for students. Check out my <a href="about.html#experience">tutoring experience</a>
                and <a href=services.html>tutoring services</a> to learn more, or <a href=signup.html>sign up</a> for
                your first session.</div>

            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <div id="indent">My goal is to become a scientific software engineer and apply my computer science skills
                to the field of chemistry. With a background in both chemistry and computer science, I think
                it would be great to develop chemistry software to be more user friendly and
                applicable to current research. Additionally, I hope to continue teaching and growing my tutoring
                buisiness.</div>
