                <h3>Where does in-person tutoring take place?</h3>
                <p>In person tutoring is held at the Fruitville Public Library in Sarasota at the
                    intersection of Fruitville Rd and Lake Wood Ranch Blvd.</p>

                <h3>What site do you use for online tutoring?</h3>
                <p>I use zoom for online tutoring. I require use of zoom for sessions due to their
                    ‘whiteboard’ feature.</p>

                <h3>What should the student bring to the tutoring session?</h3>
                <p>At minimum, the student must bring a homework or classwork assignment (complete
                    or incomplete) that lets me know where they are in class. However, the more info
                    they bring, the more accurate I can be with keeping them on track with their level.
                    My preference is to have access to the textbook and know ahead of time what lesson
                    in the book the class in on.</p>

                <h3>How many hours/sessions per week are recommended?</h3>
                <p>I recommend starting with one two-hour session per week and we can adjust based on
                    what level the student is at and what level they should be at.</p>

                <h3>Pricing</h3>
                <p>Pricing is based on grade level and location. In person tutoring is held at Fruitville
                    Public Library in Sarasota, FL.</p>
